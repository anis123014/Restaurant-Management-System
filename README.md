The Restaurant Management System helps the restaurant manager to manage the restaurant more effectively and efficiently by computerizing meal ordering, billing and inventory control. This management system is designed for a Chinese Restaurant and the interface will be in Chinese.

The system processes transaction and stores the resulting data. Reports will be generated from these data which help the manager to make appropriate business decisions for the restaurant. For example, knowing the number of customers for a particular time interval, the manager can decide whether more waiters and chefs are required
